### About the work

Channels is a light and motion installation featuring two motors and four LED light tubes in each frame, with variations ranging from 5 to 10 frames per exhibition. Originally, Channels was a pattern generated by an engineer on a computer before being transformed into a physical installation. The frames create a mesmerizing and dazzling effect for the audience.

### Show Design

In this edition, Channels was invited to the Taiwan Golden Indie Music Award, the largest indie music award in Taiwan, to accompany a performance by the famous masked Japanese singer Yama. The light and motion were specially designed to synchronize with Yama's two songs, "Haru" and "Oz." The movement of the installation is controlled by programmable motors, with real-time signals sent to the lights and motors using DMX. I utilize mathematical calculations to determine the motor positions and generate corresponding light effects.
