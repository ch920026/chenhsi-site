  Tender Ocean Soul, an outdoor installation that detects the direction and strength of the wind, converting it into real-time light patterns. It utilizes a new type of liquid LED to provide evenly distributed light. A light show occurs every 15 minutes.

### About The Work

How do you perceive the wind? Can it be seen? These questions, although clich√©, continue to intrigue artists.

Keelung, an essential harbor city in Taiwan, sits at the northern tip of the Jiali Mountains, overlooking the confluence of the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Inspired by Keelung's distinctive harbor-side culture, 'Tender Soul of Ocean' aims to delve into the city's relationship with the sea.

The installation's design mimics the shape of waves. By detecting real-time wind strength and direction, we translate this data into patterns of light. Our objective is to seamlessly connect the audience's experience of the wind with the flow of lights as they enter the installation.

For this installation WHYIXD cooperated with Liquidleds Lighting Corporation. Their leds can provide a smooth and strong led light directly, which allows the installation appearance to be concise and elegant. The LEDs are hang with stainless wirer and electricity is transported through the stainless wires directly.

### Light Deisgn

The installation equipped with wind speed and direction sensor. The sensed data will transfer through the microcontroller and then be sent to the computer. The computer program (Processing) will then generate the corresponding light pattern in real time. The light will start flowing in the same direction as the wind.

I designed three light patterns corresponding to different wind intensities: breeze, moderate, and strong. The breeze pattern features thin lines, mimicking the subtle sensation of a gentle breeze passing through. As the wind strengthens to a moderate level, the patterns transition into gradients that cover the entire area, creating a sense of being enveloped by a vast expanse of wind. Finally, for strong winds, numerous rapidly moving particles are employed to simulate the chaotic sensation of a powerful wind disrupting everything in its path.

Despite the wind patterns, a light show occurs every 15 minutes. Comparing to the organic and random style of wind patterns, I designed the show with a relatively electric and digital style. Utilizing simple geometric patterns, the lights flash rapidly and consistently.
